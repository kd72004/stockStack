# üß† Project Architecture ‚Äì stockStack

Built a stock market simulator with a custom trading engine and real-time order matching algorithm.
Used Redis for fast, in-memory order book management and periodic polling for live stock price updates.
Implemented user authentication, watchlist, and transaction history for a realistic trading experience.

1. üë§ User
Context:
Used for authentication, account management, and linking with orders, portfolio, watchlist, and transactions.

Description:
User has the following attributes:

name as a string

email_id as a unique string

password as a string

balance as a number with default value 0

createdAt and updatedAt for timestamps

Interacts With:

Order to place buy or sell requests

Portfolio to manage holdings

TransactionHistory to log completed trades

Watchlist to track selected stocks

Redis for user ID in order books

2. üßæ Order
Context:
Created whenever a user places a buy or sell request. Orders are pushed to Redis for real-time matching.

Description:
Order contains:

user_id linked to a User

stock_id linked to a Stock

qty as a number

price as a number

type which can be either BUY or SELL

status which can be OPEN by default, or change to PARTIAL, FILLED, or CANCELLED

createdAt and updatedAt for timestamps

Interacts With:

User who placed the order

Stock the order is for

Redis which stores the order in heaps

TransactionHistory after a match is made

Portfolio when ownership changes after matching

3. üîÄ Matching Engine
Context:
Runs continuously to match buy and sell orders using Redis.

Description:
The engine pulls from Redis keys:

stock followed by stock ID and BUY for max heap

stock followed by stock ID and SELL for min heap

It compares top orders and on a successful match:

Updates the order status

Creates a new TransactionHistory entry

Modifies the portfolio for both buyer and seller

Decreases the quantity in the Stock

Interacts With:

Redis to fetch and update orders

Order to update statuses

TransactionHistory to log trades

Portfolio to update holdings

Stock to adjust available quantity

4. üìä Stock
Context:
Represents a tradable company stock and includes data for the platform and analytics.

Description:
Stock includes the following fields:

stock_name

company_name

sector

open

upper_circuit and lower_circuit

qty available for trade

market_cap

pe_ratio

dividend_yield

about

ceo

headquarters

createdAt and updatedAt for timestamps

Interacts With:

Order when user places a trade

Portfolio when user owns a stock

Watchlist when user follows a stock

TransactionHistory for each executed trade

PriceHistory to track value changes

Redis to manage stock's order book

5. üß∫ Portfolio
Context:
Tracks the user's holdings in different stocks.

Description:
Portfolio includes:

user_id linked to the User

stock_id linked to the Stock

qty indicating how many shares the user owns

price_of_purchase

date_of_purchase

Interacts With:

User who owns the shares

Stock being held

TransactionHistory to reflect updates

Order when holdings are modified after matching

6. üßæ TransactionHistory
Context:
Keeps a record of successful trades for reporting and profit or loss calculations.

Description:
Transaction record includes:

user_id

stock_id

price at which trade happened

buy_or_sell to indicate direction

qty of shares traded

date of the transaction

Interacts With:

User who completed the trade

Stock that was traded

Portfolio to update quantity or remove

Order to reference matched orders

7. üïê PriceHistory
Context:
Maintains the price trend for each stock for frontend charting and analysis.

Description:
It stores:

stock_id linked to Stock

price value

timestamp when price was recorded

Interacts With:

Stock to map price changes

Frontend to display graphs

Matching Engine which can update prices during trades

8. üëÄ Watchlist
Context:
Lets users track specific stocks they‚Äôre interested in.

Description:
Watchlist includes:

user_id linked to User

stock_id linked to Stock

createdAt and updatedAt for timestamps

Interacts With:

User who created the watchlist

Stock being followed

Can later integrate with notification system

9. ‚ö° Redis
Context:
Redis is used as a high-speed in-memory store for maintaining live order books and enabling the matching engine.

Description:
Each stock has two Redis keys:

stock followed by stock ID and BUY

stock followed by stock ID and SELL

Each Redis list contains entries like:

user_id

qty

price

timestamp

Orders are sorted using heaps:

BUY orders are stored in a max-heap so highest price has priority

SELL orders are stored in a min-heap so lowest price is matched first

Interacts With:

Order for inserting and fetching real-time data

Matching Engine as core storage for logic

User ID as part of each order entry

Stock to organize buy and sell books
